Do textbook problems 12.18, and 12.24.  Submit a plain text file answer.txt that solves these two problems.

Also, submit a file treethread.c that is like hello.c (Figure 12.13), except that it creates and reaps 2**N - 2 joinable threads, where N is a positive command-line argument. These threads should be created as a binary tree rooted in the main thread. The 2**(N - 1) leaf threads should simply print "Hello, world\n" and return; the other threads should create and reap their two children before printing "Hello, world\n" then returning. The main thread counts as a thread and so should print too. If N=1, the main thread is a leaf.

Also, submit a file threethread.tr created by 'strace -o treethread.tr -f ./treethread 3' on a SEASnet GNU/Linux machine, where ./treethread is the executable produced by compiling treethread.c. This example should create 6 threads, since 2**3 - 2 == 6.
